We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or exclusion based on the following characteristics or attributes:

- Age
- Body size
- Visible or invisible disability
- Ethnicity
- Sex characteristics
- Gender identity and expression
- Level of experience
- Education
- Socio-economic status
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race
- Religion
- Sexual identity and orientation

We pledge to engage with one another in ways that actively foster an open, inclusive, diverse, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

We believe that the following behaviours are essential for creating a positive and welcoming environment within our community:

- **Demonstrating Empathy and Kindness:** Show empathy and kindness towards all members of our community. Treat each other with respect and compassion, valuing each individual's unique experiences and perspectives.

- **Respect for Differing Opinions:** Embrace a culture of respect for differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. Encourage open and constructive discussions.

- **Constructive Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback and gracefully accept it in return. We acknowledge our mistakes, take responsibility for them, and offer sincere apologies to anyone affected. We view these moments as opportunities for personal growth and learning.

- **Community-Centric Focus:** Strive for actions that are not just in our individual self-interest but also promote the well-being of our entire community. Make decisions and contribute in ways that benefit the greater whole.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We will not tolerate any form of unacceptable behaviour within our community, which includes but is not limited to:

- **Sexualized Language or Imagery:** Inappropriate use of sexual language or imagery, as well as any form of sexual attention or advances, is strictly prohibited.

- **Trolling and Insults:** Trolling, insulting, or making derogatory comments towards others, including personal or political attacks, is considered harmful behaviour.

- **Harassment:** Engaging in public or private harassment is unacceptable. Harassment includes any persistent and unwelcome behaviour that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for others.

- **Privacy Violations:** Publishing someone's private information, including their physical address or email, without their explicit permission is a breach of trust and respect for personal privacy.

- **Inappropriate Conduct:** Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate within a professional setting is not permitted.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with

permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behaviour.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or

with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
